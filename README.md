## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery

### Takeaways

The two big things I want to take away from this project and into future ones are learning more about BEM naming with CSS and Flexbox. 

BEM did make it feel like it was easier to find and organize the code. I used what I could remember of BEM but I think I may have used it wrong and plan to look into it more for my next project. 

Flexbox is amazingly useful and while I think I'm getting the hang of the basics and I know I have a lot more to learn about positioning and using it with media queries to make responsive layouts. 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Kevin Powell's responsive design course has been invaluable to me as of late and his other resources are just as instructive.
